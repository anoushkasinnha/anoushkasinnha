- 👋 Hi there, I’m Anoushka!
- 🦩 Pronouns: She/Her
- 🔭 I’m interested in exploring the myriad avenues of data interpretation; journeying through cyber security & cyber governance, and learning more about the frontiers of the global tech evolution everyday.  
- 💾 Presently, I'm delving into different data analysis tools and diving into Python to kickstart my journey :)
- 💻 I'm down to collaborate on projects that are intriguing, innovating, and beginner-friendly! 
- 📫 You can reach me at sinhanoushka@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/anoushka259/. 
- 🏕 Fun fact: When I'm not glued to my desk, you'll often catch me scaling boulders in a climbing gym or trekking through the regal northern Himalayas. As an adventure junkie, I thrive on seeking out new challenges and exploring the outdoors.
