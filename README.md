- 🦩 Pronouns: She/Her
- 🔭 I’m interested in exploring the myriad avenues of data interpretation; journeying through cyber security & cyber governance, and learning more about the frontiers of the global tech evolution everyday.  
- 💾 Presently, I'm delving into different data analysis tools and diving into Python to kickstart my journey :)
- 💻 I'm down to collaborate on projects that are intriguing, innovating, and beginner-friendly!

- 🏕 Fun fact: When I'm not glued to my work, you'll often catch me scaling boulders in a climbing gym or trekking through parts of the regal Himalayas. As an adventure junkie, I thrive on seeking out new challenges and exploring the outdoors.
